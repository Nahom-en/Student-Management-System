# Student-Management-System

This is a project of console based student management system  which allows for student to check and follow up their grades, when teachers edit their scores, they will receive an update through their email. 

I started this project when I have been learning in College their was a big problem through our schools grade portal students wont get an update when their grade is added to portal and if they have correction on their grade , they won’t get an update when out grade is updated. So it caused us many inconveniences with teachers and the portal also doesn’t work for many times. So this console based system I made it because I thought it gonna fix this problems.
